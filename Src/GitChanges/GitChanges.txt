Changes:
- Redesigned the architecture of the FileSystem handling to allow for easy addition/creation of more "storage" containers.
- Note: Still have not written the write function for the FileSystem class.
- Reorganised the folder structure to cause less clutter.

Next:
- Redesigning the sensor architecture. (Changes have been made, but are going to be deleted in favour of the new architecture).
